    <h4>Kharkiv</h4>
    <p>
      My favorite city that I have visited is Kharkiv. It is the second-largest
      city in Ukraine and a place full of history, culture, and life. I was
      impressed by its wide streets, beautiful squares, and modern architecture
      combined with historical buildings. One of the most remarkable spots is
      Freedom Square, which is one of the largest city squares in Europe.
      Kharkiv is also known for its many universities and young, dynamic
      atmosphere. But now during the war, things have changed. However, even
      now, I was impressed cleanliness of the city I enjoyed walking through its
      green parks, visiting cozy cafés, and feeling the welcoming spirit of the
      people. This city left me with many bright memories and a strong desire to
      come back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S. If I was asked where I'd live, I'd definitely say, that it's Kharkiv,
      because it's the best city not only in Ukraine, but in the whole world.
